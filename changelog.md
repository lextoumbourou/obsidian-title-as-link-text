# Changelog

All notable changes to the Title As Link Text plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.9] - ⚙️  Enhanced Settings

- **Configurable Frontmatter Property**: You can now specify which frontmatter property to use for getting the title (defaults to `title`). This allows you to use custom properties like `name`, `heading`, or any other field in your frontmatter.
- **Reset to Defaults Button**: Added a button in settings to quickly reset all configuration options to their default values.

## [1.1.8] - ⚙️  Settings toggle and bug fix

- Skip updating links with subheadings/anchors (e.g., `[[Page#Heading]]`, `[[Page#^quote]]`) (#6)
- Add auto-update toggle to disable automatic link updates on save/rename (#7)
- Add settings toggle to turn off front matter and/or first heading as title source. (#8)
- Handle links in headings. (#10)

## [1.1.7] - ✨ Features and Fixes

- Added new command: `Update links for current file`<br>
  Updates only the currently active note instead of the entire vault -- useful for large vaults or making isolated changes.<br>
  _(Note that this is the command that runs automatically when editing a note.)_
- In Markdown mode, ensure that exact title matching always wins over aliases.

## [1.1.6] - 🐛 Bug Fix

- Prevent updating of image alt text when using `![Alt text](some-img.jpg)`.
- Don't change link text if pointing to a header within the same document. (#3)

## [1.1.4] - 🚀 Release version

- Mainly just a code cleanup, and ensuring the all platforms are supported.
